# Getting Started

Welcome to the Python documentation!

If you're new to Python, we recommend starting with the learn course. The interactive course with quizzes will guide you through everything you need to know to use Python.

If you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you're always welcome to ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kingchuuks).

### System Requirements
Your system should be running either of the following
- Linux- Ubuntu 16.04 to 17.10
- Windows 7 to 10
- 2GB RAM (4GB preferably)

## Install Python using the installer
To get the newest version of Python:

1. Download the installer package from Python's official website
2. Double-click the package to start the installation process
3. Follow the on-screen instructions in the Python installer
4. Once fully installed, open Python's installation directory in a new Finder window

## Confirm Your Python Installation
Check if Python is currently installed:

1. In your Python folder, double-click the file named IDLE to launch Python shell
2. Enter enter a simple Python print command and run it in IDLE to check if it runs well
```bash
print('Hello, world!')
```
3. Hit the Return (or Enter) key, and you should get your message printed on the interface

## Install a source-code editor
A source-code editor allows you to write and execute code with ease. Most advanced editors come with an in-built terminal for running commands and scripts.

Popular editors for Python are Visual Studio Code (recommended), Sublime Text and Atom.
