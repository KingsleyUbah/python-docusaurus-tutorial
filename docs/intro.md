# Getting Started

Welcome to the Python documentation!

If you're new to Python, we recommend starting with the learn course. The interactive course with quizzes will guide you through everything you need to know to use Python.

If you have questions about anything related to Next.js, you're always welcome to ask me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kingchuuks).

### System Requirements
To run Python without issues, your system run one of these OS:
- Linux: Ubuntu 16.04 to 17.10
- Windows 7 to 10
- MacOS
- 2GB RAM (4GB preferably)

## Install Python using the installer
To get the newest version of Python:

1. Download the installer package from Python's [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Double-click the package to start the installation process
3. Follow the on-screen instructions in the Python installer
4. Once fully installed, open Python's installation directory in a new Finder window

## Confirm Your Python Installation
Check if Python is correctly installed:

1. In your Python folder, double-click the file named IDLE to launch Python shell
2. Enter this simple Python print command in IDLE to check to check it works well
```bash
print('Hello, world!')
```
3. Hit the Return (or Enter) key
4. If you got "Hello, world", then Python is properly installed

## Install a source-code editor
A source-code editor allows you to write and execute code with ease. Most advanced editors come with an in-built terminal for running commands and scripts, as well as extensions to help ypu add features to make development more seamless.

Popular code editors for Python are [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or VSCode), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and [Atom](https://github.com/atom). Some of these editors are free to use while others are paid softwares.

:::tip Tip

PyCharm is the way to go if you want a powerful, focused, and well-configured Python development environment. However, we recommend VS Code (for this guide) as it's lightweight and easy to customize.

:::

If you installed VSCode, make sure to install the recommended extensions when the option arises.
